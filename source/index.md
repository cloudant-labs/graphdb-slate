# Overview

Some business opportunities are best expressed in terms of the relationships between data,
and the characteristics of those relationships.
As an analogy,
for some problems,
it's not what you know,
it's who you know.
In other words,
it's relationships as well as the data that enable extra value for you.

You can describe collections of Information,
and the Relationships between the collections,
using a [Graph Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database).

A graph database is designed to help you answer questions about large or complex networks of inter-related data.
They represent data as 'vertices',
sometimes called 'nodes'.
The relationships between vertices are represented by connections called 'edges'.
Graph databases also store metadata or 'properties' about vertices and edges.

Graph database applications include modelling and applying social networks,
constructing and developing recommendation engines,
and 'optimal route' challenges such as finding the [shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem)
or solving the [vehicle routing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem).

IBM Graph Data Store enables you to build and work with powerful applications,
using a fully-managed graph database service,
accessible through a REST-based HTTP API interface.

<aside class="warning">IBM Graph Data Store is an experimental service.
This means that data held in the Graph Data Store is not necessarily being backed up.
In particular,
the experimental nature of IBM Graph Data Store means that it should not currently be used for high volume,
high performance, or production applications.</aside> 

### Powered by Apache TinkerPop

The IBM Graph Data Store service is based on the
[Apache TinkerPop&trade;](http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/)
stack for building high-performance graph applications.

This means that the service provides you with a set of simplified Graph Data Store API commands,
an Apache TinkerPop v3 compatible API,
and the full Apache TinkerPop v3 query language.
The service gives you flexibility and capabilities,
based on a familiar environment.
Using the Bluemix dashboard,
you can bind the Graph Data Store to your applications easily.

### Connecting to Graph Data Store services

The Graph Data Store service provides a REST API that enables you to store your
data in a [graph database]().
You can easily discover and explore the relationships in a property graph with index-free adjacency using vertices, edges, and properties. The Graph Data Store provides a graph-based NoSQL store that creates a rich
and extensible representation of your data in an accessible way.


IBM Graph Data Store features are available using HTTP REST endpoints.
These endpoints provide an easy way to connect to the graph data store,
making it ideal for web and mobile applications.

### Working with Graph Data Store services

You can perform tasks with the IBM Graph Data Store in two ways:

1.	Using the full Apache TinkerPop v3 query language.
2.	Using the IBM Graph Data Store simplified API commands.

Whichever route you choose to access and query your data,
IBM Graph Data Store helps you create powerful applications
that work with simple or complex collections of data and relationships.
