# What is a graph database?

A graph database is a database that uses graph structures with vertices (nodes and dots), edges (arcs and lines), and properties to represent and store data. This structure provides index-free adjacency. Structuring data in a graph database makes looking at the data set simple. Each element contains a direct pointer to its adjacent elements. Therefore, no index lookups are necessary. Graph processing is called traversal. “If you can whiteboard it, you can graph it,” is the new mantra.
