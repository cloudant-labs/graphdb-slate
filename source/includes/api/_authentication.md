## Authentication

Authentication means proving who you are.
This is typically done by providing your user credentials for verification.
There are two ways that clients can provide credentials (authenticate)
with Cloudant: Basic authentication and Cookie authentication.

Basic authentication is similar to showing an ID at a door for checking every time you want to enter.
Cookie authentication is similar to having a key to the door so that you can let yourself in whenever you want. The key is a cookie named `AuthSession`.

### Basic Authentication

> Example of providing basic authentication credentials in a request:

```http
GET /db/document HTTP/1.1
Authentication dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com
```

```python
import cloudant

url = "https://{0}:{1}@{0}.cloudant.com".format(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
account = cloudant.Account(url)
ping = account.get()
print ping.status_code
# 200
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com");

account.request(function (err, body) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

With Basic authentication, you pass along your credentials as part of every request by adding an `Authentication` header. The value is the base-64 encoding of your username, followed by `:`, followed by your password. However, most HTTP libraries do this encoding for you.

### Cookie Authentication

Method | Path | Description | Headers | Form Parameters
-------|------|-------------|---------|----------------------
`POST` | `/_session` | Do cookie based user login | `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | name, password
`GET` | `/_session` | Returns cookie based login user information | AuthSession cookie returned by POST request | —
`DELETE` | `/_session` | Logout cookie based user | AuthSession cookie returned by POST request | —
 
Once created, you send the cookie with all requests that require you to be authenticated.
You can use the cookie until it expires. Logging out causes the cookie to expire immediately.

#### Requesting a cookie

> Request a cookie

```http
POST /_session HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 32
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: */*

name=YourUserName&password=YourPassword
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_session \
     -X POST \
     -c /path/to/cookiefile
     -d "name=$USERNAME&password=$PASSWORD"
```

> Reply to request for a cookie

}
```

```python
import cloudant

account = cloudant.Account(USERNAME)
login = account.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
print login.status_code
# 200
logout = account.logout()
print logout.status_code
# 200
all_dbs = account.all_dbs()
print all_dbs.status_code

```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var cloudant = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");
var cookies = {}

cloudant.auth($USERNAME, $PASSWORD, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    cookies[$USERNAME] = headers['set-cookie'];
    cloudant = nano({
      url: "https://"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com",
      cookie: cookies[$USERNAME] 
    });

    // ping to ensure we're logged in
    cloudant.request({
      path: 'test_porter'
    }, function (err, body, headers) {
      if (!err) {
        console.log(body, headers);
      }
    }); 
  }
});
```

With Cookie authentication, you use your credentials to acquire a cookie.
Do this by sending a `POST` request to `/_session`.
If your credentials are valid,
the response is a cookie which remains active for twenty-four hours.

#### Getting cookie information

> Example request for cookie information:

```http
GET /_session HTTP/1.1
Cookie: AuthSession="a2ltc3RlYmVsOjUxMzRBQTUzOtiY2_IDUIdsTJEVNEjObAbyhrgz"; Expires=Tue, 05 Mar 2013 14:06:11 GMT; Max-Age=86400; Path=/; HttpOnly; Version=1
Accept: application/json
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_session \
     -X GET \
     -b /path/to/cookiefile
```

> Example response to request for cookie information.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "info": {
    "authentication_db": "_users",
    "authentication_handlers": ["cookie", "default"],
    "authenticated":"cookie"
  },
  "userCtx": {
    "name": "username",
    "roles": ["_admin","_reader","_writer"]
  }
}
```

When a cookie has been set, information about the logged in user can be retrieved with a `GET` request.

<h3></h3>
#### Deleting a cookie

> Example cookie `DELETE` request:

```http
DELETE /_session HTTP/1.1
Cookie: AuthSession="a2ltc3RlYmVsOjUxMzRBQTUzOtiY2_IDUIdsTJEVNEjObAbyhrgz"; Expires=Tue, 05 Mar 2013 14:06:11 GMT; Max-Age=86400; Path=/; HttpOnly; Version=1
Accept: application/json
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/_session \
     -X DELETE \
     -b /path/to/cookiefile
```

> Example response to cookie `DELETE` request:

```
200 OK
Cache-Control: must-revalidate
Content-Length: 12
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 04 Mar 2013 14:06:12 GMT
server: CouchDB/1.0.2 (Erlang OTP/R14B)
Set-Cookie: AuthSession=""; Expires=Fri, 02 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; Max-Age=0; Path=/; HttpOnly; Version=1
x-couch-request-id: e02e0333
```

```json
{
  "ok": true
}
```

You can end the session by sending a `DELETE` request to the same URL used to create the cookie. The `DELETE` request must include the cookie you wish to delete.
