## Documents

Documents are [JSON objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example).
Documents are containers for your data, and are the basis of the Cloudant database.

All documents must have two fields:
a unique `_id` field, and a `_rev` field.
The `_id` field is either created by you,
or generated automatically as a [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) by Cloudant.
The `_rev` field is a revision number, and is [essential to Cloudant's replication protocol](guides.html#document-versioning-and-mvcc).
In addition to these two mandatory fields, documents can contain any other content expressed using JSON.

<aside>Cloudant uses an [eventually consistent](./basics.html#consistency) model for data. This means that under some conditions, it is possible that if your application performs a document write or update, followed immediately by a read of the same document, older document content is retrieved. In other words, your application would see the document content as it was *before* the write or update occurred. For more information about this, see the topic on [Consistency](./basics.html#consistency).</aside>

<h3 id="documentCreate">Create</h3>

> Creating a document:

```http
POST /$DATABASE HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE \
     -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "$JSON"
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");
var db = account.use($DATABASE);

db.insert($JSON, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

```json
{
  "_id": "apple",
  "item": "Malus domestica",
  "prices": {
    "Fresh Mart": 1.59,
    "Price Max": 5.99,
    "Apples Express": 0.79
  }
}
```

To create a document, make a POST request with the document's JSON content to `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE`.

<div></div>

###### h6

> Example response:

```json
{
  "ok":true,
  "id":"apple",
  "rev":"1-2902191555"
}
```

The response is a JSON document containing the ID of the created document, the revision string, and `"ok": true`. If you did not provide an `_id` field, Cloudant generates one automatically as a [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). If creation of the document failed, the response contains a description of the error.

### Read

> Reading a document:

```http
GET /$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID HTTP/1.1
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");
var db = account.use($DATABASE);

db.get($JSON._id, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

To retrieve a document, make a GET request to `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID`.
If you do not know the `_id` for a particular document,
you can [query the database](#get-documents) for all documents.

<div></div>

###### h6

> Example response:

```json
{
  "_id": "apple",
  "_rev": "1-2902191555",
  "item": "Malus domestica",
  "prices": {
    "Fresh Mart": 1.59,
    "Price Max": 5.99,
    "Apples Express": 0.79
  }
}
```

The response contains the document you requested or a description of the error, if the document could not be retrieved.

<aside class="warning">
Due to the distributed, eventually consistent nature of Cloudant, reads might return stale data. In particular, data that has just been written, even by the same client, might not be returned from a read request immediately following the write request. To work around this behaviour, a client can cache state locally. Caching also helps to keep request counts down and thus increase application performance and decrease load on the database cluster. This also applies to requests to map-reduce and search indexes.
</aside>

### Read Many

To fetch many documents at once, [query the database](#get-documents).

### Update

> Updating a document

```http
PUT /$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID HTTP/1.1
```

```shell
// make sure $JSON contains the correct `_rev` value!
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID \
     -X PUT \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "$JSON"
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");
var db = account.use($DATABASE);

// make sure $JSON contains the correct `_rev` value!
$JSON._rev = $REV;

db.insert($JSON, $JSON._id, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

```json
{
  "_id": "apple",
  "_rev": "1-2902191555",
  "item": "Malus domestica",
  "prices": {
    "Fresh Mart": 1.59,
    "Price Max": 5.99,
    "Apples Express": 0.79,
    "Gentlefop's Shackmart": 0.49
  }
}
```

To update (or create) a document, make a PUT request with the updated JSON content *and* the latest `_rev` value (not needed for creating new documents) to `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID`.

<aside>If you fail to provide the latest `_rev`, Cloudant responds with a [409 error](basics.html#http-status-codes).
This error prevents you overwriting data changed by other processes.</aside>

<div></div>

###### h6

> Example response:

```json
{
  "ok":true,
  "id":"apple",
  "rev":"2-9176459034"
}
```

The response contains the ID and the new revision of the document or an error message in case the update failed.

<div id="document-delete"></div>

### Delete

> Delete request

```http
DELETE /$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID?rev=$REV HTTP/1.1
```

```shell
// make sure $JSON contains the correct `_rev` value!
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID?rev=$REV -X DELETE
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://"+$USERNAME+":"+$PASSWORD+"@"+$USERNAME+".cloudant.com");
var db = account.use($DATABASE);

// make sure $JSON contains the correct `_rev` value!
db.destroy($JSON._id, $REV, function (err, body, headers) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

To delete a document, make a DELETE request with the document's latest `_rev` in the querystring, to `https://$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/$DOCUMENT_ID`.

<aside>If you fail to provide the latest `_rev`, Cloudant responds with a [409 error](basics.html#http-status-codes).
This error prevents you overwriting data changed by other clients.</aside>

<aside class="warning">
CouchDB doesn’t completely delete the specified document. Instead, it leaves a tombstone with very basic information about the document. The tombstone is required so that the delete action can be replicated. Since the tombstones stay in the database indefinitely, creating new documents and deleting them increases the disk space usage of a database and the query time for the primary index, which is used to look up documents by their ID.
</aside>

###### h6

> Deletion response:

```json
{
  "id" : "apple",
  "ok" : true,
  "rev" : "3-2719fd4118"
}
```

The response contains the ID and the new revision of the document or an error message in case the update failed.

### Bulk Operations

> Request to update/create/delete multiple documents:

```http
POST /$DATABASE/_bulk_docs HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_bulk_docs -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$JSON"
```

```javascript
var nano = require('nano');
var account = nano("https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com");
var db = account.use($DATABASE);

db.bulk($JSON, function (err, body) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log(body);
  }
});
```

```json
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "name": "Nicholas",
      "age": 45,
      "gender": "female",
      "_id": "96f898f0-f6ff-4a9b-aac4-503992f31b01",
      "_rev": "1-54dd23d6a630d0d75c2c5d4ef894454e"
    },
    {
      "name": "Taylor",
      "age": 50,
      "gender": "female"
    },
    {
      "_id": "d1f61e66-7708-4da6-aa05-7cbc33b44b7e",
      "_rev": "1-a2b6e5dac4e0447e7049c8c540b309d6",
      "_deleted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The bulk document API allows you to create and update multiple documents at the same time within a single request. The basic operation is similar to creating or updating a single document, except that you batch the document structure and information. When creating new documents the document ID is optional. For updating existing documents, you must provide the document ID, revision information, and new document values.

#### Request Body

For both inserts and updates the basic structure of the JSON document in the request is the same:

<table>

}]
```

The HTTP status code tells you whether the request was fully or partially successful. In the request body, you get an array with detailed information for each document in the request.

<table>

#### Inserting Documents in Bulk

To insert documents in bulk into a database you need to supply a JSON structure with the array of documents that you want to add to the database. You can either include a document ID for each document, or allow the document ID to be automatically generated.

For example, the following inserts three new documents with the supplied document IDs. If you omit the document ID, it will be generated:

The return type from a bulk insertion will be 201, with the content of the returned structure indicating specific success or otherwise messages on a per-document basis.

The return structure from the example above contains a list of the documents created, here with the combination and their revision IDs:

The content and structure of the returned JSON will depend on the transaction semantics being used for the bulk update; see bulk-semantics for more information. Conflicts and validation errors when updating documents in bulk must be handled separately; see bulk-validation.

#### Updating Documents in Bulk

The bulk document update procedure is similar to the insertion procedure, except that you must specify the document ID and current revision for every document in the bulk update JSON string.

For example, you could send the following request:

The return structure is the JSON of the updated documents, with the new revision and ID information:

You can optionally delete documents during a bulk update by adding the `_deleted` field with a value of `true` to each document ID/revision combination within the submitted JSON structure.

The return type from a bulk insertion will be 201, with the content of the returned structure indicating specific success or otherwise messages on a per-document basis.

The content and structure of the returned JSON will depend on the transaction semantics being used for the bulk update; see bulk-semantics for more information. Conflicts and validation errors when updating documents in bulk must be handled separately; see bulk-validation.

#### Bulk Documents Transaction Semantics

> Response with errors

```json
[
   {
      "id" : "FishStew",
      "error" : "conflict",
      "reason" : "Document update conflict."
   },
   {
      "id" : "LambStew",
      "error" : "conflict",
      "reason" : "Document update conflict."
   },
   {
      "id" : "7f7638c86173eb440b8890839ff35433",
      "error" : "conflict",
      "reason" : "Document update conflict."
   }
]
```

Cloudant will only guarantee that some of the documents will be saved if your request yields a 202 response. The response will contain the list of documents successfully inserted or updated during the process.

The response structure will indicate whether the document was updated by supplying the new `_rev` parameter indicating a new document revision was created. If the update failed, then you will get an `error` of type `conflict`.

In this case no new revision has been created and you will need to submit the document update with the correct revision tag, to update the document.

#### Bulk Document Validation and Conflict Errors

The JSON returned by the `_bulk_docs` operation consists of an array of JSON structures, one for each document in the original submission. The returned JSON structure should be examined to ensure that all of the documents submitted in the original request were successfully added to the database.

The structure of the returned information is:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="20%" />
<col width="36%" />
<col width="26%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Field</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
<th align="left">Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">docs [array]</td>
<td align="left">Bulk Documents Document</td>
<td align="left">array of objects</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Fields of objects in docs array

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="12%" />
<col width="50%" />
<col width="12%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Field</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
<th align="left">Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">id</td>
<td align="left">Document ID</td>
<td align="left">string</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">error</td>
<td align="left">Error type</td>
<td align="left">string</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">reason</td>
<td align="left">Error string with extended reason</td>
<td align="left">string</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When a document (or document revision) is not correctly committed to the database because of an error, you should check the `error` field to determine error type and course of action. Errors will be one of the following type:

#### `conflict`

    The document as submitted is in conflict. If you used the default bulk transaction mode then the new revision will not have been created and you will need to re-submit the document to the database.

    Conflict resolution of documents added using the bulk docs interface is identical to the resolution procedures used when resolving conflict errors during replication.

#### `forbidden`

> in validation function

```
throw({forbidden: 'invalid recipe ingredient'});
```

> Error from validation function

```json
{
   "id" : "7f7638c86173eb440b8890839ff35433",
   "error" : "forbidden",
   "reason" : "invalid recipe ingredient"
}
```

Entries with this error type indicate that the validation routine applied to the document during submission has returned an error.
