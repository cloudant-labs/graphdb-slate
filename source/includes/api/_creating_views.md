## Working with Views

Views are used to obtain data stored within a database.
Views are written using Javascript functions.

### View concepts

Views are mechanisms for working with document content in databases.
A view can selectively filter documents.
It can speed up searching for content.
It can be used to 'pre-process' the results before they are returned to the client.

Views are simply Javascript functions,
defined within the view field of a design document.
When you use a view,
or more accurately when make a query using your view,
the system applies the Javascript function to each and every document in the database.
Views can be complex.
You might choose to define a collection of Javascript functions to create the overall view required.

### A simple view

> Example of a simple view, using a map function:

```
function(employee) {
  if(employee.training) {
    emit(employee.number, employee.training);
  }
}
```

> Simplified example data:

```json
{
  "_id":"23598567",
  "number":"23598567",
  "training":"2014/05/21 10:00:00"
}

{
  "_id":"10278947",
  "number":"10278947"
}

{
  "_id":"23598567",
  "number":"23598567",
  "training":"2014/07/30 12:00:00"
}
```

> Example response from running the view query

```json
{
  "total_rows": 2,
  "offset": 0,
  "rows": [
    {
      "id":"23598567",
      "number":"23598567",
      "training":"2014/05/21 10:00:00"
    },

    {
      "id":"23598567",
      "number":"23598567",
      "training":"2014/07/30 12:00:00"
    }

  ]
}
```

The simplest form of view is a map function.
The map function produces output data that represents an analysis (a mapping) of the documents stored within the database.

For example,
you might want to find out which employees have had some safety training,
and the date when that training was completed.
You could do this by inspecting each document,
looking for a field in the document called "training".
If the field is present,
the employee completed the training on the date recorded as the value.
If the field is not present,
the employee has not completed the training.

Using the `emit` function in the example view function makes it easy to produce a list in response to running a query using the view.
The list consists of key and value pairs,
where the key helps you identify the specific document and the value provides just the precise detail you want.
The list also includes metadata such as the number of key:value pairs returned.

<aside class="notice">The document `_id` is automatically included in each of the key:value pair result records.
This is to make it easier for the client to work with the results.</aside>

### Map function examples

#### Indexing a field

> Example of indexing a field:

```
function(doc) {
  if (doc.foo) {
    emit(doc._id, doc.foo);
  }
}
```

This map function checks whether the object has a `foo` field and emits the value of this field. This allows you to query against the value of the foo field.

#### An index for a one to many relationship

> Example of indexing a one to many relationship:

```
function(doc) {
  if (doc.friends) {
    for (friend in friends) {
      emit(doc._id, { "_id": friend });
    }
  }
}
```

If the object passed to `emit` has an `_id` field, a view query with `include_docs` set to `true` will contain the document with the given ID.

#### Complex Keys

Keys are not limited to simple values. You can use arbitrary JSON values to influence sorting.

When the key is an array, view results can be grouped by a sub-section of the key. For example, if keys have the form [year, month, day] then results can be reduced to a single value or by year, month, or day. See HttpViewApi for more information. 

### Reduce functions

> Example of a reduce function:

```
function (key, values, rereduce) {
  return sum(values);
}
```

If a view has a reduce function, it is used to produce aggregate results for that view. A reduce function is passed a set of intermediate values and combines them to a single value. Reduce functions must accept, as input, results emitted by its corresponding map function '''as well as results returned by the reduce function itself'''. The latter case is referred to as a ''rereduce''.

Reduce functions are passed three arguments in the order ''key'', ''values'', and ''rereduce''.

Reduce functions must handle two cases:

1.	When `rereduce` is false:
  -	`key` will be an array whose elements are arrays of the form `[key,id]`, where `key` is a key emitted by the map function and ''id'' is that of the document from which the key was generated.
  -	`values` will be an array of the values emitted for the respective elements in `keys`, for example: `reduce([ [key1,id1], [key2,id2], [key3,id3] ], [value1,value2,value3], false)`

2.	When `rereduce` is true:
  -	`key` will be `null`.
  -	`values` will be an array of values returned by previous calls to the reduce function, for example: `reduce(null, [intermediate1,intermediate2,intermediate3], true)`\`

Reduce functions should return a single value, suitable for both the "value" field of the final view and as a member of the "values" array passed to the reduce function.

Often, reduce functions can be written to handle rereduce calls without any extra code, like the summation function described previously. In that case, the `rereduce` argument can be ignored.

#### Built-in reduce functions

For performance reasons, a few simple reduce functions are built in. To use one of the built-in functions, put its name into the `reduce` field of the view object in your design document.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="11%" />
<col width="88%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Function</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>_sum</code></td>
<td align="left">Produces the sum of all values for a key, values must be numeric</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>_count</code></td>
<td align="left">Produces the row count for a given key, values can be any valid json</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>_stats</code></td>
<td align="left">Produces a json structure containing sum, count, min, max and sum squared, values must be numeric</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

By feeding the results of `reduce` functions back into the `reduce` function, MapReduce is able to split up the analysis of huge datasets into discrete, parallelized tasks, which can be completed much faster.

### Dbcopy

If the `dbcopy` field of a view is set, the view contents will be written to a database of that name. If `dbcopy` is set, the view must also have a reduce function. For every key/value pair created by a reduce query with `group` set to `true`, a document will be created in the dbcopy database. If the database does not exist, it will be created. The documents created have the following fields:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="18%" />
<col width="81%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Field</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>key</code></td>
<td align="left">The key of the view result. This can be a string or an array.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>value</code></td>
<td align="left">The value calculated by the reduce function.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>_id</code></td>
<td align="left">The ID is a hash of the key.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>salt</code></td>
<td align="left">This value is an implementation detail used internally.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>partials</code></td>
<td align="left">This value is an implementation detail used internally.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<aside>
Dbcopy should be used carefully, since it can negatively impact the performance of a database cluster.

 1. It creates a new database, so it can use a lot of disk space.
 2. Dbcopy can also be IO intensive, and building a dbcopy target can adversely affect the rest of the cluster.
 3. It can behave in some unexpected ways. Notably, if a design document with a dbcopy target is created, and the target database has been built, editing this design document so that some documents, which were previously copied, are no longer copied, does not lead to those documents being deleted from the target database. This behavior differs from that of normal views.

### Storing the view definition

> Example for `PUT`ting a view into a design document (`training`):

```http
PUT /$DATABASE/_design/training HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

```shell
curl -X PUT https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DATABASE/_design/training --data-binary @view.def
# where the design document is stored in the file `view.def`
```

> Example format for the view:

```json
{
  "views" : {
    "hadtraining" : {
      "map" : "function(employee) { if(employee.training) { emit(employee.number, employee.training); } }"
    }
  }
}
```

Each view is a Javascript function.
Views are stored in design documents.
So,
to store a view,
we simply store the function definition within a design document. A design document can be [created or updated just like any other document](#update).   

Do this by `PUT`ting the view definition content into a `_design` document.
In this example,
the `hadtraining` view is defined as a map function,
and is available within the `views` field of the design document.

### Using Views

Views enable you to search for content within a database,
that matches specific criteria.
The criteria are specified within the view definition,
or supplied as arguments when you use the view.

-   **Method**: `GET /db/_design/<design-doc>/_view/<view-name>`
-   **Request**: None
-   **Response**: JSON of the documents returned by the view
-   **Roles permitted**: \_reader

Executes the specified `view-name` from the specified `design-doc` design document.

#### Query Arguments

> Example of retrieving a list of the first five documents from a database, applying the user-created `by_title` view:

```http
GET /<database>/_design/<design-doc>/_view/by_title?limit=5 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

> Example response:

```json

   "offset" : 0,
   "rows" : [
      {
         "id" : "3-tiersalmonspinachandavocadoterrine",

         "value" : [
            null,

            "Aberffraw cake"
         ]
      },

         ]
      },
      {
         "id" : "Aioli-garlicmayonnaise",
         "key" : "Aioli - garlic mayonnaise",
         "value" : [
            null,

         ]
      },

### Indexes

When a view is defined in a design document,
a corresponding index is also created,
based on the information defined within the view.
Indexes let you select for documents by criteria other than their `_id` field, for instance by a field or combination of fields or by a value that is computed based on the contents of the document.
The index is populated as soon as the design document is created. On large databases, this process might take a while.

The index content is updated incrementally and automatically when any one of the following three events has occurred:

-   A new document has been added to the database.
-   An existing document has been deleted from the database.
-   An existing document in the database has been updated.

View indexes are rebuilt entirely when the view definition changes or when another view definition in the same design document changes.
This ensures that changes to the view definitions are reflected in the view indexes.
To achieve this,
a 'fingerprint' of the view definition is created whenever the design document is updated.
If the fingerprint changes,
then the view indexes are completely rebuilt.

<aside class="notice">View index rebuilds occur whenever a change occurs to any one view from all the views defined in the design document.
For example,
if you have a design document with three views,
and you update the design document,
all three view indexes within the design document are rebuilt.</aside>

If the database has been updated recently, there might be a delay in returning the results when the view is accessed.
The delay is affected by the number of changes to the database, and whether the view index is not current because the database content has been modified.

It is not possible to eliminate these delays, in the case of newly created databases you might reduce them by creating the view definition in the design document in your database before inserting or updating documents. This causes incremental updates to the index when the documents or inserted.

If speed of response is more important than having completely up-to-date data,
an alternative is to allow users to access an old version of the view index.
In effect,
the user has an immediate response from 'stale' index content,
rather than waiting for the index to be updated.
Depending on the document contents,
using a stale view might not return the latest information.
Nevertheless, a stale view returns the results of the view query quickly,
by using an existing version of the index.

### Accessing a stale view

For example, to access the existing stale view `by_recipe` in the `recipes` design document,
you would use a request similar to:
<code>/recipes/_design/recipes/_view/by_recipe?stale=ok</code>

Making use of a stale view has consequences.
In particular,
accessing a stale view returns the current (existing) version of the data in the view index, if it exists. The current state of the view index might be different on different nodes in the cluster.

### Sorting Returned Rows

> Example of requesting the last five records by reversing the sort order:

```http
GET /<database>/_design/<design-doc>/_view/by_title?limit=5&descending=true HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

> Example response:

```json
{
   "offset" : 0,
   "rows" : [
      {
         "id" : "Zucchiniinagrodolcesweet-sourcourgettes",
         "key" : "Zucchini in agrodolce (sweet-sour courgettes)",
         "value" : [
            null,
            "Zucchini in agrodolce (sweet-sour courgettes)"
         ]
      },
      {
         "id" : "Zingylemontart",
         "key" : "Zingy lemon tart",
         "value" : [
            null,
            "Zingy lemon tart"
         ]
      },
      {
         "id" : "Zestyseafoodavocado",
         "key" : "Zesty seafood avocado",
         "value" : [
            null,
            "Zesty seafood avocado"
         ]
      },
      {
         "id" : "Zabaglione",
         "key" : "Zabaglione",
         "value" : [
            null,
            "Zabaglione"
         ]
      },
      {
         "id" : "Yogurtraita",
         "key" : "Yogurt raita",
         "value" : [
            null,
            "Yogurt raita"
         ]
      }
   ],
   "total_rows" : 2667
}
```

The data returned by a view query is in the form of an array.
Each element within the array is sorted using native UTF-8 sorting.
The sort is applied to the key defined in the view function.

The basic order of output is as follows:

Value | Order
------|------
`null` | First
`false` |
`true` |
Numbers |
Text (lowercase) |
Text (uppercase) |
Arrays (according to the values of each element, using the order given in this table) |
Objects (according to the values of keys, in key order using the order given in this table) | Last

You can reverse the order of the returned view information by setting the `descending` query value <code>true</code>.

### Specifying Start and End Keys

> Example of querying using `startkey` and `endkey` query arguments:

```http
GET /recipes/_design/recipes/_view/by_ingredient?startkey=%22alpha%22&endkey=%22beta%22 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

The `startkey` and `endkey` query arguments can be used to specify the range of values to be displayed when querying the view.

The sort direction is always applied first.
Next, filtering is applied using the `startkey` and `endkey` query arguments.
This means that it is possible to have empty view results because the sorting and filtering do not make sense in combination.

<div></div>

> Reversing the order of start and end key will not yield any results:

```http
GET /recipes/_design/recipes/_view/by_ingredient?descending=true&startkey=%22beta%22&endkey=%22alpha%22 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

For example,
if you have a database that returns ten results when viewing with a `startkey` of "alpha" and an `endkey` of "beta",
you would get no results when reversing the order.
The reason is that the entries in the view are reversed before the key filter is applied.

<div></div>

> The view request returns no entries, because "alpha" is alphabetically before "beta". The returned result is empty:

```json
{
   "total_rows" : 26453,
   "rows" : [],
   "offset" : 21882
}
```

Therefore the `endkey` of "beta" is seen before the `startkey` of "alpha", resulting in an empty list.

<div></div>

> Example of <i>correct</i> filtering and reversing the order of output by using the `descending` query argument, and reversing the `startkey` and `endkey` query arguments:

```http
GET /recipes/_design/recipes/_view/by_ingredient?descending=true&startkey=%22egg%22&endkey=%22carrots%22 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

The solution is to reverse not just the sort order,
but also the `startkey` and `endkey` parameter values.

### Querying a view using a list of keys

> Example request to return all recipes, where the key for the view matches either "clear apple juice" or "lemonade":

```http
POST /$DB/_design/$DDOC/_view/$VIEWNAME HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

```shell
curl -X POST "https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DB/_design/$DDOC/_view/$VIEWNAME" -d @request.json
```

```json
{
   "keys" : [
      "some-key",
      "some-other-key"
   ]
}
```

This method of requesting information from a database executes the specified `view-name` from the specified `design-doc` design document. Like the `keys` parameter for the [`GET`](#querying-a-view) method,
the `POST` method allows you to specify the keys to use when retrieving the view results.
In all other aspects, the `POST` method is identical to the [`GET`](#querying-a-view) API request, in particular, you can use any of its query parameters.

<div></div>

The response contains the standard view information, but only where the keys match:

> Example returned view data

```json
{
   "total_rows" : 26484,
   "rows" : [
      {
         "value" : [
            "Scotch collops"
         ],
         "id" : "Scotchcollops",
         "key" : "claret"
      },
      {
         "value" : [
            "Stand pie"
         ],
         "id" : "Standpie",
         "key" : "clear apple juice"
      }
   ],
   "offset" : 6324
}
```

### Multi-document Fetching

> Example request to obtain the full documents that match the listed keys:

```http
POST /recipes/_design/recipes/_view/by_ingredient?include_docs=true HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "keys" : [
      "claret",
      "clear apple juice"
   ]
}
```

Combining a `POST` request to a given view, with the `include_docs=true` query argument, enables you to retrieve multiple documents from a database.
This technique is more efficient than using multiple [`GET`](#querying-a-view) API requests.
However,
`include_docs=true` adds a slight overhead compared to accessing the view on its own.

### Sending several queries to a view

> Example request:

```http
POST /$DB/_design/$DESIGNDOC/_view/$VIEW HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

```shell
curl https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$USERNAME.cloudant.com/$DB/_design/$DESIGNDOC/_view/$VIEW -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @request-body.json
# where request-body.json is a file containing the following JSON data:
```

```json
{
  "queries": [{

  }, {
    "startkey": 1,
    "limit": 2
  }]
}
```

> Example response:

```json

To send several view queries in one request, use a `POST` request to `/$DB/_design/$DESIGNDOC/_view/$VIEW`. The request body is a JSON object containing only the `queries` field. It holds an array of query objects with fields for the parameters of the query. The field names and their meaning are the same as the query parameters of a regular view request.

The JSON object returned in the response contains only the `results` field, which holds an array of result objects - one for each query. Each result object contains the same fields as the response to a regular view request.
