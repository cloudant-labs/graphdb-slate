# IBM Graph Data Store

Some business opportunities are best expressed in terms of the relationships between data,
and the characteristics of those relationships.
As an analogy,
for some problems,
it's not what you know,
it's who you know.
In other words,
it's relationships that enable extra value.

You can describe collections of Information,
and the Relationships between the collections,
using a Graph Database.

A graph database is designed to help you answer questions about large networks of inter-related data.
They represent data as 'vertices',
sometimes called 'nodes'.
The relationships between vertices are represented by connections called 'edges'.
Graph databases also store metadata or 'properties' about vertices and edges.

Graph database applications include modelling and applying social networks,
constructing and developing recommendation engines,
and 'optimal route' challenges such as finding the [shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem)
or solving the [vehicle routing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem).

IBM Graph Data Store enables you to build and work with powerful applications,
using a fully-managed graph database service,
accessible through a REST-based HTTP API interface.

In particular,
IBM Graph Data Store offers an Apache TinkerPop&trade; v3 compatible API,
giving you flexibility and capabilities based on a familiar environment.
Using the Bluemix dashboard,
you can bind the Graph Data Store to your applications easily.

<aside class="warning">IBM Graph Data Store is an experimental service.
This means that data held in the Graph Data Store is not necessarily being backed up.
In particular,
the experimental nature of IBM Graph Data Store means that it should not currently be used for high volume,
high performance, or production applications.</aside> 

## Powered by Apache TinkerPop

The IBM Graph Data Store service is based on the [Apache TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/)
stack for building high-performance graph applications.

## Connectivity

IBM Graph Data Store features are available using HTTP REST endpoints.
These endpoints provide an easy way to connect to the graph data store,
making it ideal for web and mobile applications.

## Expressive

You can perform tasks with the IBM Graph Data Store in two ways:

1.	Using the full Apache TinkerPop v3 query language.
2.	Using the IBM Graph Data Store simplified API commands.

Whichever route you choose to access and query your data,
IBM Graph Data Store helps you create powerful applications
that work with simple or complex collections of data and relationships.
